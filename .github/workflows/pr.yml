      # We currently rely on the Github Actions cache to cache our container image layers.
      # The tradeoffs relative to using the container registry as a cache are not yet clear.
      # For example:
      # - Using Dockerhub as a cache would allow local builds and CI builds to share the same cache.
      # - Dockerhub has announced a rate-limit of 200 pulls/6 hrs for unpaid accounts.
      # - The Github cache evicts when it grows above 5GB.
      # To use the container registry as a cache, replace the cache-from/cache-to lines below with:
      #   cache-from: type=registry,ref=farmng/${{ matrix.image }}:latest
      #   cache-to: type=inline
