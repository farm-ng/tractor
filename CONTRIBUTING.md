If you have an idea about how the project should evolve, [create an issue](https://github.com/farm-ng/tractor/issues/new/choose) with the tag `enhancement` or `idea`.

This issue will act like a sounding board for design. Link to pull requests in the issue to reference any design documents (as `.md` files), prototype code, or an implementation. Once the issue has sprouted, and has a life of its own in an implementation PR, transcribe the summary or conclusions of the design discussion into the `design/` directory, and include those notes in the implementation PR.

Use Github's [Linked Issues](https://help.github.com/en/github/managing-your-work-on-github/linking-a-pull-request-to-an-issue) feature to automatically close the issue when the implementation PR is merged.

Markdown files are automatically rendered as a github page [here](https://docs.farm-ng.com/tractor/).
